  <h2> About Mika</h2>
<p>Mika's core research interests lie in understanding socially-motivated phenomena like revenge,
forgiveness, and cooperation. To understand these processes, she integrates theory and methods from social
and evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and behavioral economics.
Mika emphasizes the use of interdisciplinary scholarship to inform social policy and intervention development.
</p>

<p>As an undergraduate, Mika studied psychology and international relations at the University of New Mexico
where she investigated the effects of meditation and non-invasive brain stimulation on the perception of emotions.
She also studies human performance and cognitive enhancement at Sandia National Laboratories.
As of 2016, Mika began the journey to a Ph.D. in psychology/integrative neuroscience at the University of Chicago
where she is advised by Dr. Jean Decety. Their work explores how socially-motivated emotions and behaviors
influence the interactions of individuals and groups. </p>
