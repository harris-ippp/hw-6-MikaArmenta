    <h2> <a id = "GnG"></a> Effects of A Norm for Forgiveness on Cooperation and Intergroup Bias</h2>
    <p>
      Can relations between individuals from different social groups be improved
      by changing group norms? Specifically, will a norm that encourages
      forgiveness increase cooperation with both in- and outgroup members, and
      will attitude changes predict variation in cooperation? Although
      psychologists have separately explored relationships between intergroup
      dynamics and antisocial normative influence, and intergroup dynamics and
      forgiveness, little empirical work has examined the influence of a prosocial
      norm, forgiveness, on intergroup cooperation. This project investigates
      the relationship between an individualâ€™s perception that forgiveness is the
      common response within their group to transgressions and their
      cooperative decision-making. Because forgiveness encourages cooperation,
      because cooperation decreases intergroup bias, and because humans are fundamentally
      motivated to follow norms, examining this triad in the context of intergroup
      relations contributes to a growing body of literature on group dynamics
      and behavior science, and has wider applicability in intervention and
      public policy development.

    <h2> <a id = "AltUseForgive"></a> Alternative Uses of Forgiveness </h2></br>

    <p>
      Can forgiveness be used in relationships without a history of cooperation,
      and if so do different cultural emphases on shame and guilt, proximate
      emotions associated with forgiveness and deterrence, affect how it is
      employed? Do different cultural emphases on these emotions affect the
      development of forgiveness in children? Specifically, this study aims to
      identify the extent to which children from a society that emphasizes shame
      (Japan) and children from a society that emphasizes guilt (United States)
      understand that forgiveness can be used to engender these self-conscious
      emotions in transgressors in order to deter them from imposing future costs
      and encourage them to confer benefits on the forgiver when the relationship
      does not have a history of cooperation. While forgiveness may protect cooperative
      relationships from the negative effects of revenge, this study proposes to
      explore a possible variant on forgiveness. Instead of being used to maintain
      cooperative relationships, forgiveness may also be used to establish them.

    <h3><a> A social neuroscience perspective on radicalization </a></h3>
<p>
  Why do some people become radicalized and regard political violence as a
  legitimate means of effecting political change? We will examine the underlying
  social, psychological, and neural mechanisms involved in radicalization and
  how they facilitate support for political violence. This project will integrate
  empirical evidence across multiple levels of analysis and methodologies,
  including social, behavioral, and cognitive neuroscience. </br>
  </br>
  In Year 1, a battery of online questionnaires will measure moral values,
  political and social attitudes, personality and cognitive styles, and demographic
  variables from 1,000 individuals in the Chicago area.</br>
  </br>
  In Years 2 and 3, a subset of 160 participants with extreme political views will
  undergo a MRI scanning session to assess attitudes towards political violence,
  sensitivity to fairness, and cognitive flexibility. Analyses will integrate
  dispositional, behavioral, and functional neuroimaging data to test the
  hypothesis that the strength of interindividual political views is
  mediated by a limited number of psychological and neurobiological dimensions
  that are associated with vulnerability to extremism and support for political
  violence.
